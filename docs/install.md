# Installation

The only dependency is libgretl. 

- On Ubuntu, this is satisfied by installing the package `libgretl1-dev`.
- If you're installing on another Linux, be sure you install the development library for libgretl. Installing only the GUI program won't work. 
- On Windows, the binary will include all the necessary dll files.
